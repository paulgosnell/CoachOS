   - Start articles with definitive answers
   - Use "According to research..." with citations
   - Include statistics and data points

2. **Structured Content**
   - Use clear headings (H2, H3)
   - Bullet points for scannability
   - Frameworks and step-by-step guides

3. **Original Insights**
   - Include unique perspectives
   - Real founder stories (can be anonymized)
   - Actionable frameworks not found elsewhere

4. **Credibility Markers**
   - Author bio (Paul's background)
   - Citations to research
