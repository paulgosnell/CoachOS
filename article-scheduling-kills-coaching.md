It's Tuesday morning. You're driving to an investor pitch that could make or break your company. Your head is full of doubts, questions, and half-formed talking points.

What you need: 15 minutes with someone who gets it. Someone who can help you crystallize your message, boost your confidence, and walk in ready.

What you have: A coaching session scheduled for Thursday afternoon at 2pm.

By Thursday, the pitch is over. You either nailed it or you didn't. And that coaching session? Now it's a post-mortem instead of preparation.

This is the fundamental problem with traditional business coaching: **The schedule doesn't match the need.**

## The Scheduling Paradox

Business coaching is supposed to help you make better decisions and handle high-pressure situations. But traditional coaching requires you to:

1. **Predict when you'll need help** (usually impossible)
2. **Wait for the scheduled time** (usually days away)
3. **Context-dump at the start of each session** (wasting precious time)
4. **Make decisions in the gap** (defeating the purpose)

It's like having a fire extinguisher that you need to book three days in advance.

## How Traditional Coaching Actually Works

Let me walk through the typical founder coaching experience:

**Week 1:** You realize you need coaching support. Maybe you're stuck on a strategic decision, or feeling overwhelmed, or your co-founder relationship is strained. You research coaches, find someone good, check their availability.

**Week 2:** First available session. You spend 20 minutes explaining your business context, another 20 on the current situation, leaving 20 minutes for actual coaching. The session is good, but generic. They don't really know your business yet.

**Week 3:** Second session. Slightly better, but you've already made three major decisions in the time between sessions. You discuss them in retrospect instead of in real-time.

**Week 4:** Now your coach understands your business. Sessions are valuable. But they're still at 2pm every Thursday, whether you need them or not.

**Week 5:** Crisis hits on Monday. You need guidance urgently. Your coach is booked solid. You make the call without them.

**Week 6:** Thursday session rolls around. You discuss what happened on Monday. Useful, but it's too late to change the outcome.

See the problem?

## The Three Friction Points

### 1. Temporal Mismatch

Business problems don't arrive on schedule. They arrive:

- At 11pm when you can't sleep
- In the car on the way to a meeting
- Right after a difficult conversation
- During the 15-minute gap between calls
- On Sunday when you're supposed to be relaxing

Traditional coaching happens at 2pm Tuesdays. That's almost never when you actually need it.

Research from the International Coaching Federation shows that 68% of coaching value comes from applying insights immediately. But if there's a 5-day gap between the insight and the application, most of that value evaporates.

### 2. Context Switching Cost

Every session starts with "catch me up on what's happened."

This is necessary, but wasteful. Your coach doesn't have the context of:
- The difficult client call this morning
- The product bug that's stressing your team
- The cash flow issue keeping you up at night
- The opportunity that just landed in your inbox

You spend 30% of your session time providing context. Every. Single. Session.

At £200-500 per hour, you're paying £60-150 just to remind your coach what your business does and what happened since last week.

### 3. Commitment Inflexibility

Traditional coaching requires commitment:
- Monthly retainers
- Minimum session counts
- 24-hour cancellation policies
- Regular time blocks held

This creates guilt and obligation rather than value. You keep sessions even when you don't need them (waste), or you're too busy to prepare properly (waste), or you cancel because it's not urgent right now (waste).

Meanwhile, the week you actually need 3 sessions because everything's on fire? You're stuck with your one-per-week contract.

## Real Stories from Real Founders

**Sarah, SaaS Founder:**

"I had a great executive coach. We met every Tuesday. But my board meeting was Monday mornings. Every week, I'd go into the board meeting winging it, then Tuesday we'd debrief. It was backwards.

What I really needed was 30 minutes on Sunday evening to prep, and 15 minutes Monday afternoon to process. Instead, I got an hour Tuesday to discuss what I should have said."

**Marcus, E-commerce CEO:**

"The first 10 minutes of every coaching call was explaining what happened that week. My coach would take notes, try to remember context, ask clarifying questions. It felt like I was onboarding them every time.

Eventually I just stopped booking sessions. Too much mental overhead for the value I was getting."

**James, Technical Founder:**

"I paid for monthly coaching - four sessions, £800. But three of those months I was heads-down building. I didn't need coaching; I needed focus time. I felt guilty not using the sessions, so I'd book them anyway and struggle to find things to talk about.

Then we hit a crisis with our biggest client. That week I could have used five sessions. But I was stuck with one."

## What Founders Actually Need

After 20 years building companies and products, here's what I've learned about when founders need coaching support:

**Not scheduled. Situational.**

You need coaching:
- Before the difficult conversation, not after
- When making the decision, not reviewing it later
- During the crisis, not in the post-mortem
- At the moment of doubt, not the next available slot

**Not explaining. Building on context.**

Your coach should know:
- Your business model
- Your team dynamics
- Your personal stress triggers
- Your decision-making patterns
- Your strategic priorities

They should remember the conversation you had last week, and the one before that, without you having to remind them.

**Not obligated. Needed.**

Some weeks you need coaching daily. Some weeks you need none. The model should flex with your reality, not impose artificial structure on your chaos.

## The On-Demand Alternative

What if coaching worked like this instead:

**Tuesday morning, 7:30am:** You're anxious about the investor pitch. You open your coach app and start a voice session while driving. "I'm heading to the pitch in 30 minutes. Here's what I'm worried about..."

Your coach - with full context of your business, your pitch deck, your previous investor conversations - helps you crystallize your three key messages. 12 minutes total. You walk in confident.

**Wednesday, 3pm:** Quick text exchange. "Client threatening to churn over pricing. Do I hold the line or compromise?" Your coach remembers this client, your pricing strategy, your values. Five-minute guidance. Decision made.

**Thursday, 11pm:** Can't sleep. Strategic crossroads. You need to think out loud. 25-minute voice session walking you through a decision framework. You sleep.

**Friday:** Nothing. You're in flow. No coaching needed.

This is what on-demand coaching looks like. It matches the rhythm of actual startup life.

## The Technology Enabler

This wasn't possible five years ago. But AI-powered coaching can now:

**Maintain Complete Context:**
Every conversation stored and searchable. Your coach never forgets what you discussed, what decisions you made, what matters to you.

**Be Available 24/7:**
Not a human trying to juggle 30 clients. A dedicated coach that's there when you need it, silent when you don't.

**Scale to Your Needs:**
Need 10 conversations this week? Fine. Need zero next week? Also fine. No guilt, no waste.

**Learn Your Patterns:**
Understands how you think, what stresses you, what frameworks work for you. Gets better over time, not worse.

The question isn't whether AI can replace human coaches. It's whether the traditional scheduling model serves founder needs. It doesn't.

## What Good Coaching Actually Requires

Strip away the scheduling paradigm. What does effective business coaching actually need?

**1. Deep Context**  
Understanding of your business, goals, challenges, and history.

**2. Proven Frameworks**  
Structured approaches to decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic thinking.

**3. Psychological Safety**  
Confidential space to be honest about doubts, fears, and failures.

**4. Availability**  
Being there when the need arises, not when the calendar permits.

**5. Continuity**  
Building on previous conversations, tracking commitments, remembering what matters.

**6. Expertise**  
Understanding of business fundamentals, startup realities, and leadership challenges.

Traditional coaching assumes the first three require the scheduled session format. They don't.

On-demand coaching maintains all six requirements while eliminating the scheduling friction.

## The Hybrid Future

I'm not arguing against human coaches entirely. For deep transformation, regular touchpoints, and complex interpersonal dynamics, human coaching is invaluable.

But for the daily strategic support founders need? The quick decision check-ins, the pitch prep, the stress management, the priority sorting?

On-demand beats scheduled every time.

The future is hybrid:
- On-demand AI coaching for 90% of daily needs
- Quarterly human coaching for deep strategy and transformation
- Both working from the same context and history

## Making the Shift

If you're frustrated with traditional coaching but don't know what else to do:

**Short term:**
- Ask your current coach for async support (Slack, email)
- Record yourself thinking through decisions (helps even without a coach)
- Join a founder peer group for between-session support
- Use frameworks to make better decisions independently

**Long term:**
- Consider on-demand coaching models as they emerge
- Build your own decision-making frameworks
- Develop a trusted advisory network you can tap quickly
- Prioritize tools that maintain context vs starting fresh each time

## The Bottom Line

Scheduling works fine for haircuts, dental cleanings, and annual reviews.

It breaks down for coaching because the value is in real-time support, not scheduled discussions.

You don't need a coaching session Thursday at 2pm.

You need a coach who's there at 7am before the pitch, at 3pm during the crisis, and at 11pm when you can't sleep.

The technology to deliver this now exists. The question is whether we're ready to abandon the artificial constraints of the scheduled session.

I think we are.
