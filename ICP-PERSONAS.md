## Persona Deep-Dives

### Persona 1: "Overwhelmed Owen" - Solo Technical Founder

**Background:**
Owen, 34, is a technical founder who built an AI SaaS product that's gaining traction. He's secured pre-seed funding and has 3 contractors. He codes 60% of the time, does everything else 40% of the time. No business background, learning as he goes.

**A Day in Owen's Life:**

**6:30am:** Wakes up after fragmented sleep. Checks Slack on phone before getting out of bed. Already anxious about unresolved customer issue from yesterday.

**7:00am:** Coffee + inbox triage. 47 unread emails. Tries to prioritize but everything feels urgent.

**8:00am:** Customer support crisis. Demo broken for trial customer. Drops everything to fix.

**10:30am:** Finally fixed. Two hours gone. Hasn't touched the strategic work planned for today.

**11:00am:** Investor wants to talk. No agenda. 45-minute call that could have been an email. They ask questions Owen doesn't have good answers for.

**12:00pm:** Supposed to eat lunch. Instead, stress-scrolls Twitter while eating standing up.

**1:00pm:** Contractor has questions about architecture. Hour-long Zoom explaining decisions.

**2:30pm:** Finally time to code. The work he actually enjoys and is good at.

**4:00pm:** Interrupted. Potential customer wants demo. Has to context-switch completely.

**5:30pm:** Demo went okay but not great. Realizes marketing site doesn't explain product well. Adds to growing todo list.

**6:00pm:** Exhausted. Should stop. But there's that feature that's blocking everything.

**9:00pm:** Still coding. Ordered takeout. Girlfriend annoyed he's working again.

**11:00pm:** In bed. Can't sleep. Thinking about:
- Did he answer that investor question correctly?
- Is the current approach right?
- Should he hire someone?
- How to hit growth targets?
- Whether he's cut out for this?

**11:30pm:** Opens phone. Considers texting founder friend but it's too late. Wishes he had someone to just talk this through with. Finally falls asleep around 1am.

**Owen's Coach OS Use Cases:**

**Morning (7:30am):** Quick voice message while making coffee: "I've got that investor call at 11am and I'm dreading it. Can you help me think through what they're actually asking about and what good answers sound like?"

**Midday Crisis (10:45am):** Text: "Production is down, customer trial is affected. Do I drop everything to fix this personally or delegate? Need perspective fast."

**Evening (6:30pm):** Voice session while walking: "Feeling overwhelmed. Everything's on fire. Help me figure out what actually matters this week vs what can wait."

**Late Night (11pm):** Text: "Can't sleep. Keep spiraling about whether I'm focusing on the right things. Talk me through my priorities?"

### Persona 2: "Scaling Sarah" - Series B CEO

**Background:**
Sarah, 42, founded a FinTech company 6 years ago. Raised Series B (£15M). Team of 85 people. Strong exec team but still feels isolated. Transition from founder-mode to CEO-mode challenging.

**A Day in Sarah's Life:**

**5:45am:** Alarm. Meditation app (trying to build the habit). Coffee while scanning overnight Slack messages and urgent emails.

**6:30am:** Gym class. One hour she protects fiercely. Knows she needs it to function.

**8:00am:** Kids breakfast before school. Tries to be present but mentally planning day.

**9:00am:** Office. First meeting: Sales pipeline review. Numbers not where they need to be.

**10:00am:** All-hands planning. Trying to align 85 people toward Q4 goals.

**11:00am:** Emergency call with CFO. Burn rate higher than projected. Difficult decisions ahead.

**12:00pm:** Lunch meeting with potential Board advisor. Valuable but exhausting to be "on."

**1:30pm:** Back-to-back 1-on-1s with direct reports. CTO frustrated with pace. CPO wants more resources. CMO has team conflict.

**5:00pm:** Should leave for family dinner. Stays for one more meeting with Product.

**6:30pm:** Finally leaves. Guilty about being late again.

**7:00pm:** Family dinner. Distracted. Thinking about the burn rate conversation.

**8:00pm:** Kids to bed. Opens laptop. "Just 30 minutes" to prep for board meeting.

**10:30pm:** Still working. Partner annoyed. She knows she's not present.

**11:00pm:** Lies in bed. Tomorrow: Board meeting. Knows she needs to present difficult update about extending runway. Unsure of best approach. Wishes she had someone to pressure-test her thinking with.

**Sarah's Coach OS Use Cases:**

**Morning (7am, post-gym):** Voice while driving: "Board meeting tomorrow and I need to deliver bad news about burn rate. Help me think through how to frame this as opportunity vs crisis."

**Between Meetings (2:30pm):** Text: "Just had difficult 1-on-1 with CTO. He threatened to leave if we don't change approach. Can't lose him. Need perspective on whether to give in or hold the line."

**Evening (8:30pm):** Text: "Supposed to be having family time but can't stop thinking about work. This balance thing isn't working. What am I doing wrong?"

**Sunday (4pm):** Voice session: "Week ahead planning. Feeling pulled in 10 directions. Help me prioritize what only I can do vs what I should delegate."

### Persona 3: "Corporate Chris" - VP of Digital Innovation

**Background:**
Chris, 48, has been at a Fortune 500 retail company for 12 years. Recently promoted to VP of Digital Innovation. Excited but overwhelmed. Large budget but massive bureaucracy. Considering leaving for a startup.

**A Day in Chris's Life:**

**6:00am:** Wakes. Morning run (training for half-marathon). Time to think clearly.

**7:30am:** Family breakfast. Kids are teenagers now. Quality time before everyone scatters.

**8:30am:** Commute. Catches up on industry podcasts. Feeling behind on innovation trends.

**9:00am:** Office. First meeting: Status update with SVP. Politics, not substance.

**10:00am:** Innovation team standup. Good team but frustrated by organizational barriers.

**11:00am:** Meeting with Legal about new initiative. Simple idea, complex approval process.

**12:00pm:** Lunch with external startup CEO. Envious of their speed and autonomy.

**1:30pm:** Procurement meeting. Trying to buy tools team needs. Months-long process.

**3:00pm:** Executive steering committee. His initiative deprioritized for third time.

**4:30pm:** 1-on-1 with top engineer who's considering leaving for startup. Can't blame them.

**6:00pm:** Finally some focus time. Writes strategy doc for transformation initiative.

**7:00pm:** Heads home. Sustainable hours at least. But is the impact worth it?

**8:00pm:** Dinner with partner. Vents about organizational frustration.

**9:00pm:** LinkedIn scrolling. Startup founder friends posting about launches and growth. Feels stuck.

**10:00pm:** Bed. Thinking: Should he leave for a startup? Take the financial risk? Is this as good as it gets? At 48, is he too old to make a change?

**Chris's Coach OS Use Cases:**

**Morning (7am, during run):** Voice: "Saw another initiative get blocked yesterday. Starting to think real innovation isn't possible here. Am I wasting my time?"

**Midday (12:30pm):** Text after lunch: "Just met with a startup CEO. So envious. Should I leave? How do I evaluate this decision objectively?"

**Evening (8pm):** Voice session: "Trying to build startup culture in corporate environment. Is this possible or am I Don Quixote?"

**Weekend (Saturday 10am):** Text: "Recruiter reached out with startup COO role. Half the salary but equity and autonomy. Walk me through how to think about this."
