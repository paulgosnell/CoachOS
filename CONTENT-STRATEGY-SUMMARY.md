## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Publishing Inconsistently**
   - Better to do 1/week consistently than 5 one week, 0 for three weeks
   - Set realistic schedule and stick to it

2. **Over-Optimizing for SEO**
   - Write for humans first, SEO second
   - Keyword stuffing hurts more than helps
   - Focus on value, not just rankings

3. **Ignoring Distribution**
   - Publishing isn't enough
   - Actively promote each piece
   - Engage with comments

4. **Forgetting CTAs**
   - Every article should link to waitlist
   - Make it natural, not pushy
   - Give value first, ask second

5. **Not Tracking Results**
   - Use data to inform strategy
   - Double down on what works
   - Cut what doesn't
