## Emergency Fixes

If article performs poorly (low traffic/engagement after 48 hours):

1. **Headline Problem**
   - A/B test new headline on social
   - Make it more specific or emotional
   - Add numbers or urgency

2. **Distribution Problem**
   - Reshare with different angle
   - Try different platforms
   - Ask peers to share

3. **Content Problem**
   - Add more personal stories
   - Include more actionable tips
   - Improve formatting for scannability

4. **SEO Problem**
   - Check if indexed (Google Search Console)
   - Improve title tag and meta description
   - Add more internal/external links

---

**Remember:** Every article is a long-term asset. It'll drive traffic for years if optimized properly. Don't rush publication to hit a date - get it right.

**Minimum Standard:** Would I share this with a founder friend who's struggling? If not, keep editing.
